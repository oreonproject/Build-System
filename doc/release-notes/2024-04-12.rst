Highlights from 2024-04-12 release
==================================

A small maintenance release of copr-frontend.


Enhancements
------------

- `#2996`_, `#2999`_, `#3001`_, `#3002`_ - More and more APIv3 endpoints are
  being migrated to `Flask-RESTX`_ and being documented. Please see
  https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api_3/docs


Bugfixes
--------

- `#2489`_ - The removal of temporary project was too inefficient and had to be
  temporarily disabled because it would collapse the whole copr-frontend
  server. After this release, your temporary projects should be finally removed.
- `#3056`_ - The script for checking updates from https://release-monitoring.org
  works again
- `#2601`_ - Explanation of downloaded stats is now correct


Maintenance
-----------

- `#3130`_ - Compatibility with SQLAlchemy 2.0
