Highlights from 2022-11-30 release
==================================

The :ref:`2022-11-28 release <release_notes_2022_11_28>` was
complicated and introduced more bugs than we expected. This
mini-release was solely focused on fixing them.


Bugfixes
--------

- `#2407`_ - Copr DistGit failed to import some packages. We believe
  ``systemd-oomd`` killed the process and left the repository in an
  inconsistent state

- `#2402`_ - SELinux rejected all SRPM uploads of packages larger than
  50MB (We have a special case in the code for uploading large SRPM
  files)

- `#2398`_ - A traceback caused some SRPM builds to hang in the queue
  for hours and caused also `#2390`_.

- `#2391`_ - DistGit workers didn't mark themselves as finished
  after importing a package, resulting in a performance drop and
  seemingly stuck importing queue

- `#2388`_ - Signature check caused ``copr-backend`` to fail on
  Fedora 36

- `#2393`_ - A deployment-related issue with ``systemd-oomd``
  unexpectedly killing Copr DistGit services
